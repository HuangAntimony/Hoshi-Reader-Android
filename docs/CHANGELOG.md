# Changelog

All notable user-visible changes to Hoshi Reader Android are documented here.
The format follows a Keep a Changelog style, and release sections use Semantic Versioning.
Historical release notes before v1.3.0 live in [CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md](CHANGELOG_ARCHIVE.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Keep oversized lookup popup frames fully inside the visible screen so their
  bottom border and all scrollable content remain reachable.

## [v1.3.3] - 2026-08-13

### Added

- Automatically center the current chapter when opening the Reader Contents or
  Sasayaki chapter list.
- Add per-source enable controls for imported local audio databases while
  preserving each source's configured priority.
- Add Ogg Opus audiobook import with embedded title, artist, cover, and chapter
  metadata in Sasayaki, load its artist without the platform-reader delay, and
  show MP3, M4B, and Opus audiobook duration before playback starts.
- Add a Reader Appearance swipe-threshold control for paginated and VN modes;
  setting it to zero disables swipe page turns while preserving hardware page
  keys.
- Add up to three named Anki card formats with independent icons, decks, note
  types, field mappings, tags, and duplicate states.
- Add confirmation before deleting Anki formats and an edit-screen action that
  duplicates a format and returns to the format list.
- Add Anki duplicate-note search buttons that appear only for matching notes,
  plus grouped per-format mining and search actions placed before audio.
- Add precise cloze-part handlebars, numeric pitch accent graph handlebars, and
  advanced glossary mapping options for Anki cards.

### Changed

- Increase the default lookup popup size to 500 × 500 dp and allow its
  height to be adjusted up to 1000 dp.
- Align the built-in Lapis, Kiku, and Senren field presets with iOS by no longer
  setting sentence-card marker fields.

### Fixed

- Allow importing supported files whose display names contain `#` or `?`,
  including EPUB volume numbers such as `Book #01.epub`.
- Base reduced-motion popup scrolling on the portion of the popup that is
  actually visible when its configured height exceeds the screen.
- Show Reader Contents, fragment jumps, and chapter labels for EPUBs whose
  navigation document is stored in a subdirectory.
- Prevent staggered multi-touch taps in paginated and VN Reader modes from
  being mistaken for a page-turn swipe.
- Keep Google Drive sync and TTU backup restore compatible with progress files
  whose book data IDs exceed Android's 32-bit integer range.
- Keep dictionary lookup available when tapping Sasayaki-highlighted text in VN
  Reader mode.

## [v1.3.2] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Add the option to create a new shelf while moving one or more selected books.
- Add a Reader image gallery, true table-of-contents chapter ranges, and optional
  current-chapter progress in Reader chrome and statistics.
- Add a configurable daily statistics reset time and pause reading statistics
  while Reader sheets or fullscreen images are open.
- Add optional current-book cover publishing for the Android lock screen and a
  fixed PNG file used by compatible E-ink sleep-screen tools, plus direct
  integration with iReader’s built-in Book Cover screen saver on compatible
  domestic and Musnap overseas firmware using standard PNG output, with Fit,
  Fill, and Stretch scaling modes.

### Changed

- Expand Sasayaki delay adjustment to -4...4 seconds and playback speed to
  0.5...3x.
- Rename the Reader Go to panel to Contents, order its tabs as Chapters,
  Highlights, Gallery, and Search, and remove overscroll deformation from
  scrolling surfaces throughout the app.

### Fixed

- Keep Reader progress, search, and Sasayaki character offsets stable around
  numeric HTML entities, and keep lookup sentence expansion and recursive
  expression-tag scanning within the selected text boundary.
- Keep manual bookshelf sync from rebuilding the entire shelf, while refreshing
  imported reading progress in place.
- Keep large bookshelves smooth during repeated scrolling by reusing
  size-appropriate persistent cover thumbnails instead of decoding original
  covers again after they leave memory, while recovering from transient
  generation failures or damaged thumbnail-cache entries without hiding valid
  covers.
- Remember the selected Contents and Sasayaki tabs for the current Reader
  session, and keep Sasayaki on the current tab after importing an audiobook.
- Keep VN lookups and mined Anki sentences complete when a word or sentence
  continues onto a later screen.
- Keep Anki audio, book covers, Sasayaki clips, and dictionary media from
  overwriting different exported media by using content-specific filenames.
- Keep dictionary definitions in the configured dictionary order when an
  inflected lookup merges multiple deinflection candidates.
- Keep Sasayaki jumps to cues in the previous chapter from counting the target
  chapter in the current reading session when image holding is enabled.

## [v1.3.1] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Add a Reader Appearance setting for top safe area height.

### Changed

- Improve dictionary lookup and import behavior by honoring Yomitan term scores
  and normalizing Japanese iteration marks, full-width numbers, and emphatic
  sequences.
- Raise Statistics daily goal limits to 200,000 characters and 12 hours.

### Fixed

- Keep the Statistics tab visible after enabling it and switching away from Settings.
- Refresh Statistics by-book covers when changing calendar ranges.
- Keep Reader lookup highlights from expanding to an entire ruby annotation when
  selecting a shorter word inside it.
- Keep VN vertical text from jumping to a new column immediately after a ruby
  annotation.
- Keep long-pressed Reader volume keys paging or seeking Sasayaki instead of
  falling back to system volume changes after the first press.

## [v1.3.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added

- Add a full-library Statistics tab with habit summaries, calendar range browsing, per-book distribution, daily and weekly goals, and an Advanced Statistics visibility switch.

### Changed

- Open the Reader Go to panel on Chapters by default, order its tabs as Chapters, Highlights, and Search, and focus the search field when Search is selected.

### Fixed

- Prefer exact expression-and-reading local audio matches before falling back to reading-only or expression-only entries.
- Read Sasayaki M4B title, author, and cover metadata from MP4 atoms when Android's platform metadata reader returns empty.
- Improve VN reader media screens, first-highlight display, vertical layout, punctuation wrapping, and lookup and Sasayaki highlight alignment.
- Keep VN and continuous vertical reader content aligned to the configured vertical padding instead of the bottom overlap area.
- Prevent reader lookups from crashing on words that begin with supplementary-plane kanji such as 𠮟.
- Keep Sasayaki image hold active while viewing fullscreen Reader images, and avoid repeated holds once the continuous Reader target image is already visible.
